# T Level Digital Software Development â€“ Core Content Area 1 Knowledge Library

This repository provides a comprehensive knowledge base for **Core Content Area 1: Problem Solving** from the T Level Digital Software Development qualification.

The aim is to give students and educators a black-and-white revision document that supports short-answer questions (SAQs) and long-answer questions (LAQs). It also provides a structured knowledge source for integration with GitHub Copilot agents.

## Contents

The knowledge base (in `index.html`) covers the following specification points:

- Computational Thinking (decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, algorithmic design)
- Decomposition (purpose, tasks, representation methods, application)
- Pattern Recognition (trends, similarities, predictions, assumptions)
- Abstraction (needed information, filtering, internal workings, inputs/outputs, constants/variables, repeated actions)
- Algorithmic Design (definition, characteristics, flowcharts, written descriptions, code, actions: sequence, selection, iteration)
- Algorithm Skills (purpose, outputs, error identification and correction, notation translation, design)
- Problem-Solving Strategies (top-down, bottom-up, modularisation)
- Root Cause Analysis (five whys, FMEA, ETA, logging, escalation)
- High-Level Strategy (define, gather, analyse, plan, implement, review)
- Interrelationships and Judgements (using components and strategies effectively in digital software development)

## Features

- Clear definitions, purposes, and when/why to use each concept
- Worked Python examples (PEP 8 compliant) for illustration
- Pitfalls highlighting common mistakes to avoid
- Exam tips aligned to assessment command words (give, describe, explain, discuss, evaluate)
- Appendix with glossary and quick syntax reference
## Usage

- Open `index.html` in any web browser to access the knowledge base.
- Use the structured content to revise key problem-solving theory and techniques.
- Link this resource into a GitHub Copilot agent knowledge library to generate exam-style questions and answers.
